# Azure Privilege Escalation
## Background
SIRT has received a [Azure AD member assigned Global Administrator role](https://app.datadoghq.com/security?query=%40workflow.rule.type%3A%28%22Log%20Detection%22%20OR%20%22Signal%20Correlation%22%29%20source%3Aazure&agg_m=count&agg_m_source=base&agg_t=count&column=time&event=AwAAAZW5z0WMsD8eaQAAABhBWlc1ejBXTUFBQ1lIZHUyVnhISFF3QUEAAAAkMDE5NWJhNDctNTZhZS00ZTU4LTgyYjctMmVmMDg5MTQ2OWZkAAAAFA&fromUser=false&order=desc&product=siem&start=1742303529700&end=1742908329700&paused=false) **in the Security Research Datadog Org** that has been determined to be suspicious/malicious. Investigate the signal and determine the extent of the threat actor's activity.

### Logs
The timestamps for searches can be access via this link in the **Security Research** Datadog org: [Azure Logs](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs?query=source%3Aazure%2A&agg_m=count&agg_m_source=base&agg_t=count&clustering_pattern_field_path=message&cols=host%2Cservice&fromUser=true&messageDisplay=inline&refresh_mode=paused&storage=hot&stream_sort=desc&viz=stream&from_ts=1742572800000&to_ts=1742581800000&live=false). Further filters based on the originating signal will be required to narrow down the relevant activity.

## Investigation
Start by reviewing the triggering event and understanding what is happening. 

??? question "Which user was granted the global admin role?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look at target resources to find the context of what changes were made.

    ??? info "Answer"
        `@properties.targetResources.userPrincipalName` tells us that `devindeveloper@pdedatadogoutlook.onmicrosoft.com` was granted global admin privileges.


??? question "What field gives us some insight into how the role was granted?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look for an indication the program leveraged to perform these actions.

    ??? info "Answer"
        Based on `@properties.additionalDetails` the user agent associated with this request is `python-requests/2.23.0`. This tells us that the python requests library was used, indicating the attacker is likely executing a script to make requests to the API.

??? question "Which principal is responsible for granting the global admin role?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look at the user associated with the event.

    ??? info "Answer"
        `DFIR Training - Top Dog Role Management` is the user that executed the action to grant the admin role. 

We know the principal performing the suspicious activity so let's see what other events can be tied to the user. 

??? question "What other events are present for the principal?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Execute a new search that focuses on Azure logs for the user `DFIR Training - Top Dog Role Management`.

    ??? info "Answer"
        There are two additional events tied to this principal, both are sign-in events.

??? question "What additional evidence seen in both of these events supports our finding that Python scripts may be in use by the threat actor?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look for additional references to Python.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The `@properties.authenticationProcessingDetails` field indicates that the authentication library that processed this request is MSAL Python.

??? question "What additional evidence seen in both of these events supports our finding that Python scripts may be in use by the threat actor?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look for additional references to Python.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The `@properties.authenticationProcessingDetails` field indicates that the authentication library that processed this request is MSAL Python.

??? question "What is the key difference between the two sign-in events that indicates why both events are present in a short period?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Focus on the resource associated with the authentication.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The `@properties.resourceDisplayName` field is different between the events. One is associated with `Azure Resource Manager` and the other is associated with `Graph API`.

We've reviewed all the activity tied to this service principal as the initiating actor but are still missing a lot of context. Let's broaden our search to find the presence of that principal in _any_ field. 

??? question "What is the earliest event that references the service principal?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Filter by `*:DFIR Training - Top Dog Role Management` and look at the timestamps to identify earliest event.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The first event is `Update service principal`. 

??? question "Which user is associated with this activity?"
    ??? info "Answer"
        `@usr.name` tells us `devindeveloper@pdedatadogoutlook.onmicrosoft.com` is the user performing the actions. This is interesting because before this user was the target of actions by the service prinicipal, whereas now the service principal is the target of the user.

??? question "What attribute differs from our previous events that provides insight into the methodology of the attacker?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Previously Python was in usage but we see a different access vector this time.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The `@properties.additionalDetails` field indicates that the user agent is `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0`. This indicates that these activities are taking place via a browser vs. a script.

This event alone does not provide a lot of additional context in its details. Let's understand the chain of events associated with this single one.

??? question "What other events are directly associated with this one?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        The correlation ID can be used to tie together associated events.

    ??? info "Answer"
        2 additional events are associated with the same correlation ID:   
        -  `Update application â€“ Certificates and secrets management`   
        - `Update application`

Let's start with the earliest of these additional events to see if we can expand our understanding of what is happening.

??? question "Which application was assigned a credential?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look at the target resource.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The application that had a secret generated is `DFIR Training - Top Dog Role Management`, which is the application that the service principal we've observed is tied to.

??? question "What is the display name of the key?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Look at the target resource's modified properties.

    ??? info "Answer"
        The key description that was updated is `["[KeyIdentifier=480946b1-433f-4634-8b85-bfe21266007e,KeyType=Password,KeyUsage=Verify,DisplayName=test]"]`. We can see within that string that the display name is `test`.

 ??? question "What is the other name for a key type of `Password`?"
    ??? tip "Hint"
        Check out Microsoft's documentation for [adding credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=federated-credential%2Cexpose-a-web-api#add-credentials).

    ??? info "Answer"
        As can be seen with a Google search, at the reference link in the hint, or by going directly to the portal, there is no options to "Add password". The documentation mentions the following:  
        ```
        Sometimes called an application password, a client secret is a string value your app can use in place of a certificate to identify itself.
        ```    
        While the log references `password`, in the UI we would be adding a `client secret`.
