# Welcome to the Datadog Cloud DFIR Training!

In this week's training we will be learning how to investigate cloud-based incidents. Throughout the training you will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience by working through a series of labs. Some of these labs will be focused on individual techniques while some will present an end-to-end attack scenario.
